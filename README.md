# READ ME

This project uses Husky, Prettier, ESLint. Please ensure that all three are working for you before you start
contributing to the code.

1. Check if Husky is running by trying to do a temporary commit that does not agree with Prettier or ESLint
2. Enable both Prettier and ESLint in your editor so that it can help you format code as you write it
